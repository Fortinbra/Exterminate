# Dalek Build Documentation

Central hub for building the animatronic RC Dalek. Follow steps in order (each step page has Previous / Next navigation plus a return link to this index).

## Assembly Steps (Mechanical / Lighting Phase)

1. [Step 1 – Gather / Print All Parts](./step1_parts.md) ✅
2. [Step 2 – Eyestalk Assembly](./step2_eyestalk.md) ✅
3. [Step 3 – Dome Assembly & LED Distribution Board](./step3_dome.md) ✅
4. [Step 4 – Neck Stack & Dome Integration](./step4_neck.md) ✅
5. [Step 5 – Arm & Shoulder Integration](./step5_shoulders_arms.md) ✅
6. [Step 6 – Skirt Assembly & Shoulder Attachment](./step6_skirt_assembly.md) ✅
7. [Step 7 – Fender Mechanism & Skirt Integration](./step7_fender_mechanism.md) ✅
8. [Step 8 – Wiring Harness Integration & Electronics Mounting](./step8_wiring_electronics.md) 🚧 (initial mounting only)
9. Step 9 – Firmware Flash & Configuration (📝 planned)
10. Step 10 – Gamepad Pairing & Control Mapping (📝 planned)
11. Step 11 – Audio Assets & Conversion (📝 planned)
12. Step 12 – Calibration, Tuning & Maintenance (📝 planned)

Later steps (8–12) expand into electronics, firmware, control, audio, and calibration once mechanical guide is finalized.

## Notes

- Legacy standalone dome subassembly file has been merged into Steps 2 & 3 (no separate `subassembly_dome.md`).
- Navigation blocks at the bottom of each step link forward/back and back to this index for faster browsing.
- Contributions welcome—open a PR to refine or extend planned steps.
